tx2mon - monitor ThunderX2 temperature, frequency and power

tx2mon decodes and displays the operating region of the SoC management
controller(MC). The display shows the current temperature from sensors, the
frequencies and the power measurements that is logged by the MC to host
memory.

To use tx2mon, you will need to install the corresponding kernel module
'tx2mon_kmod'. The kernel module maps the operating region to sysfs files
that are decoded by 'tx2mon' userspace application.

Usage: tx2mon [-d delay] [-f file] [-h]
Options:
 -d delay	update delay in seconds - range [0.0001..9999]
 -f csv_file	run in non-interactive mode, save data in CSV format to
		the file specified
 -h		display help text

You have to run the application as root.


The following items are reported by this tool:
 Freq (Min/Max)		: SOC frequency limits, these limits depend on the SKU used
 Temp Thresh (Soft/Max) : Limits on temperature beyong which the SOC will throttle voltage and frequency down
 For each core 		: Frequency and Temperature reading
 SOC Center Temp	: This represents the highest temperature on the SOC
 Voltage and power for the following
	Core : Voltage and power consumed by all cores on the SOC
	SRAM : Voltage and power consumed by internal SRAM on the SOC
	Mem  : Voltage and power consumed by the LLC ring on the SOC, refer to ThunderX2 HRM for details on the SOC architecture
	SOC  : Voltage and power consumed by misc SOC blocks 
	* There is additional power consumed by cross socket interconnect, PCIe and DDR IOs which will be reported in a future version of this tool
 Other information
	Memnet Frequency: Frequency used by the ring connecting the SOC, refer to ThunderX2 HRM for details on the SOC architecture
